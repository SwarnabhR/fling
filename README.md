# Flink - Decentralized Dating App

**Flink** is a decentralized dating app built on the **Polygon blockchain (Polygon POS)**, drawing inspiration from popular apps like Bumble and Hinge. Flink focuses on privacy, user ownership of data, and blockchain-powered features such as virtual currency and NFT-backed achievements. The app includes AI-powered matchmaking, smart contracts for real-world meetups, and Anon Aadhar for secure identity verification.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Matchmaking**: Uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze user behavior and preferences for more accurate match suggestions.
  
- **Privacy-Focused**: Built with privacy by design, users maintain full control over their data, with decentralized identity (DID) and encryption to ensure security.
  
- **Anon Aadhar Integration**: Prevents fake profiles through KYC and identity verification using Anon Aadhar, a blockchain-based identity management system.
  
- **Virtual Currency**: Users earn **Fling Coins** through engagement, which can be redeemed for **Solana ($SOL)** cryptocurrency.
  
- **NFT-Backed Achievements**: Users can unlock and collect NFTs for certain in-app milestones, making them unique collectibles tied to their profile.
  
- **Smart Contracts for Real-World Meetups**: Flink uses smart contracts to facilitate secure, trustless interactions between users, such as payments for shared events or booking date venues.
  
- **Self-Destructing Messages**: Users can send private, time-limited messages that automatically delete after a set duration.
  
- **Geo-Fencing for Location-Based Matches**: Helps users connect with others in their vicinity using secure and privacy-preserving location technologies.
  
- **Gamified User Challenges**: Earn rewards for completing challenges, contributing to the community, or achieving personal milestones within the app.
  
- **Crowdsourced Matchmaking**: Leveraging community-driven matchmaking, users can help suggest potential matches for others.
